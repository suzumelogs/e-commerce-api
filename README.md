## E-Commerce API - Admin CMS and User
 This project provides a robust and feature-rich API built using TypeScript, Nest.js, Prisma, and other technologies. It serves as the backend for both the admin CMS and user interfaces of an e-commerce platform. With role-based access control and comprehensive testing, this API ensures secure and seamless management of products and user interactions.
## Features
*  **Admin CMS and User API:** This API caters to both the administrative content management system and user interactions within the e-commerce platform.
*  **Role-Based Access Control:** Administrators and users have different access levels, ensuring security and privacy by restricting unauthorized actions.
*  **Guards and Authentication:** Built-in guards ensure that only authorized users can access specific routes, enhancing the overall security of the application.

* **Database Integration:** The API interfaces with a MySQL database for structured data storage and retrieval, enhancing scalability and reliability.

*  **Caching with Redis:** Redis integration boosts performance by providing caching capabilities, reducing database load for frequently accessed data.

* **Testing with Jest and Docker:** Comprehensive testing using Jest covers both unit and end-to-end scenarios. Dockerized testing environment ensures consistent and isolated testing.
